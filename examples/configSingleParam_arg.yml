# Other functional parameters
# DEISM modes: You can run DEISM using different versions
# 1. ORG: Original DEISM, which is supposed to be the most accurate, but takes the longest time
# 2. LC: Low-complexity DEISM with vectorized calculation, which is supposed to be faster than ORG, but less accurate
# 3. MIX: Early reflections up to order 2 are calculated using ORG, and the rest are calculated using LC
DEISM_specs: 
  ifRemoveDirect: 0 # If remove the direct sound from the image sources
  Mode: "MIX" # "ORG", "LC", "MIX"
  mixEarlyOrder: 2 # The order of reflections using DEISM-ORG if choose "MIX"
  numParaImages: 1500 # Number of images parallel for the calculation, information for users about RAM consumption
  # If normalize the receiver directivity if the receiver directivity is obtained by placing a point source
  # with flow strength QFlowStrength at the receiver position and measuring the sound pressure at a sphere around the receiver
  # You need to specify QFlowStrength after the following flag
