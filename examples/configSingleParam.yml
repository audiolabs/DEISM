  # Should support frequency-dependency as well,
  # i.e., for each entry in the list, it is either a complex-valued number or a filename
  # e.g., "imp_1", "imp_2". In this way, the users can load their own impedance profiles
  # An example would be:
  # ["imp_1", "imp_1", "imp_2", "imp_3", "imp_5", "imp_6"], where each "imp_#" corresponds to the name of a impedance profile
  # Loading the impedance profile is followed by a frequency interpolation from the complex-valued impedance to the frequencies defined in 5. frequency terms
  # Summary, supported input:
  # 1. AcoustImpendence: 18+0j # A single value for 6 walls, no frequency-dependency
  # 2. AcoustImpendence: [18, 20, 8, 5, 30, 19] # Different values for 6 walls, no frequency-dependency
  # 3. AcoustImpendence: "imp_1" # A name for a impedance profile to load, used for all 6 walls
  # 4. AcoustImpendence: ["imp_1", "imp_1", "imp_2", "imp_3", "imp_5", "imp_6"] # Different loaded profiles for different walls

# DEISM modes: You can run DEISM using different versions
# 1. ORG: Original DEISM, which is supposed to be the most accurate, but takes the longest time
# 2. LC: Low-complexity DEISM with vectorized calculation, which is supposed to be faster than ORG, but less accurate
# 3. MIX: Early reflections up to order 2 are calculated using ORG, and the rest are calculated using LC
DEISM_specs: 
  ifRemoveDirect: 0 # If remove the direct sound from the image sources

  # If normalize the receiver directivity if the receiver directivity is obtained by placing a point source
